Soon to be PhD in bioinformatics, with an interest in molecular evolution, phylogeny and its use in outbreak detection of infectious diseases. During my work and studies I have gained knowledge and experience in bioinformatics, especially within the field of whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of bacteria and phylogeny.

I have dedicated the first part of my career to working with infectious diseases within public health, as I feel that this an area were there is a true challenge and where I can make a difference.
