Newly graduated PhD in bioinformatics, with an interest in molecular evolution, phylogeny and its use in outbreak detection of infectious diseases. During my work and studies I have gained knowledge and experience in bioinformatics, especially within the field of whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of bacteria and phylogeny.

I currently work as a bioinformatics scientist at ALK, where I have gained new skills such as R (particularly working with tidyverse and ggplot2) and single cell genomics.
