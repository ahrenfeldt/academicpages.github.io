The use of whole genome sequencing is increasing in diagnostics. To perform outbreak analysis it is crucial to be able to make accurate phylogenetic trees. These phylogenetic trees are often based on mapping of raw reads to a reference genome. More information is however given in raw reads data, than what is being used by current methods for WGS phylogeny, which are mostly based on nucleotide calling. This information can be used by an algorithm, which utilizes all the information given when mapping raw reads to a reference genome.  The phylogenetic distance is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of each position being different. This probability is calculated using a Bayesian approach.
