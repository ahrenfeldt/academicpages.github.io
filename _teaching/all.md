This course is a hands on course in the different available tools for WGS analysis and diagnotics in microbiology. The course uses the online available toos from CGE (http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/) as the basis to teach students about WGS diagnotics.

In 2017 I was the course responsible, and did most of the teaching, including making the exam project and the written exam.

In 2016 I was a TA and taught the lecture on phylogeny and outbreak analysis.

### MetaPhylogeny - Developing a tool for metagenome phylogeny

September 2017 - March 2018

Supervising Madina Waisi on her Masters thesis. She is developing a pipeline for bacterial phylogeny on meta genome samples. She is working with tha Global Sewage data.

### Global Sewage - Viral phylogeny on metagenomic samples

August 2017 - February 2018

Supervising Christian Fiksdal Brandes on his Masters thesis. He is developing a pipeline for viral phylogeny on meta genome samples. He is working with tha Global Sewage data.


### Bioinformatic and experimental studies of antimicrobial resistance of *Klebsiella pneumonia* caused by chromosomal mutations 

September 2017 - March 2018

Co-supervising Annette Barbara Walaszek Schow on her Masters thesis. She is making a database of chromosomal mutations in *Klebsiella pneumonia*, which leads to antibiotic resistance. This she is using to characterice a group af samples, as well as doing a phylogenetic study of them. She will then go on to test the MIC values for the found resistances in the lab.

### Evergreen: a platform for surveillance of bacterial outbreaks

Febuary 2017 - June 2017

Co-supervising Judit Szarvas on her Masters thesis. Her goal was to develop a platform for surveillance of bacterial outbreaks, that makes updated phylogenetic trees of all public available data. A beta version of the platform is found here https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/Evergreen/
