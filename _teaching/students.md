Bioinformatic and experimental studies of antimicrobial resistance of *Klebsiella pneumonia* caused by chromosomal mutations 
---
September 2017 - March 2018

Co-supervising Annette Barbara Walaszek Schow on her Masters thesis. She is making a database of chromosomal mutations in *Klebsiella pneumonia*, which leads to antibiotic resistance. This she is using to characterice a group af samples, as well as doing a phylogenetic study of them. She will then go on to test the MIC values for the found resistances in the lab.
