The aim of this study was to construct a valid publicly available method
for in silico fimH subtyping of Escherichia coli particularly suitable for differentiation
of fine-resolution subgroups within clonal groups defined by standard multilocus
sequence typing (MLST). FimTyper was constructed as a FASTA database containing
all currently known fimH alleles. The software source code is publicly available
at <https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/fimtyper>, the database is freely
available at <https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/fimtyper_db>, and a service
implementing the software is available at <https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/FimTyper>.
