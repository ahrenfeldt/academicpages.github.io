title: "Bacterial whole genome-based phylogeny: Construction of a new benchmarking dataset and assessment of some existing methods"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ahrenfeldt17.pdf
excerpt: 'Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used in diagnostics and surveillance of infectious diseases. A major application for WGS is to use the data for identifying outbreak clusters, and there is therefore a need for methods that can accurately and efficiently infer phylogenies from sequencing reads. In the present study we describe a new dataset that we have created for the purpose of benchmarking such WGS-based methods for epidemiological data, and also present an analysis where we use the data to compare the performance of some current methods.'
